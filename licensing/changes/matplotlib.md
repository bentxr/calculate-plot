# Summary of changes to Matplotlib (clause 3 of the Matplotlib License)

calculate-plot contains C++ code derived from Matplotlib 3.11.2 (https://matplotlib.org,
https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/tree/v3.11.2). Each derived file names the Matplotlib file
it comes from in its first lines. The changes, as a whole:

- **Python bindings removed.** pybind11 and the Python C API are gone. NumPy array views are
  replaced by `mpl::NdArray` (src/agg/ndarray.h, our own) with the same interface, and Path objects
  by `mpl::PathIterator`/`mpl::PathGenerator` holding C++ vectors (src/agg/path.h, from
  src/py_adaptors.h). The pybind11 type casters' conversion rules (graphics context, dashes, colours,
  affines, bounding boxes, snapping) are carried over into src/render/replay.cpp, which reads them from
  a recorded trace instead of Python objects.
- **No exceptions.** Where Matplotlib throws (renderer construction, restore_region, draw_gouraud_triangles
  argument checks, Agg's cell block limit, check_trailing_shape), the port records the reason in
  `RendererAgg::error` (or returns false) and the caller reports it. draw_markers' try/catch, which only
  restored the clipping state before rethrowing, is now a plain block (its normal path already restores it).
- **Clip path identity** (`PathIterator::get_id`) is an explicit identity carried by the path (recorded from
  Matplotlib) instead of the address of a Python array.
- File names drop the leading underscore (e.g. src/_backend_agg.h is src/agg/backend_agg.h); includes follow.
- The drawing algorithms themselves (src/_backend_agg.h, src/_backend_agg.cpp, src/path_converters.h,
  src/agg_workaround.h, src/array.h, src/mplutils.h) are otherwise unchanged.
